# Portfolio site

I've decided to learn Jaspr Dart by making this portfolio site.

It's currently work in progress so a link to the hosted site will be here soon.

## What is jaspr

[Jaspr](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr) is a modern web framework for building websites in Dart.
It has a look and feel of flutter while still rendering sites in their native form. Check it's documentation [here](https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr) for more.
